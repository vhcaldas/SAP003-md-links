## 1. Product Backlog

In this project, it was created a library that can be acessed by a command line interface (CLI). The module can be imported in Node.js, and it offers an interface where you can follow an .md file to print an array with objects containing:

a. a text: text inside the Markdown;

b. an href: the found URL.

## 2. Install

One of the requisites to use this library is to previously install Node.js on your computer. It can be acessed by https://nodejs.org/en/.  

Then, the installation can be made by acessing the link ```npm install vhcaldas/md-links```.

This module can also be imported by ```require```.

## 3. CLI (Command Line Interface)

This application can be executed by terminal as the following example:

```
md-links <path-to-file>[option]
```
```
$md-Links ./some/example.md
```
